# Justin Henson — Cloud / DevOps Engineer (NZ & AU-ready)

I build **production-minded cloud infrastructure** with Terraform—secure by default, easy to operate, and **repeatable to demo** (create → verify → destroy).

## Start here (fastest review path)

* **Portfolio index (recommended order + narrative):** [https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-sponsor-portfolio](https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-sponsor-portfolio)
* **AWS Terraform baseline (core infra):** [https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-cloud-baseline-aws](https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-cloud-baseline-aws)
* **Ops / SRE runbooks (operate & improve):** [https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-ops-runbooks](https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-ops-runbooks)

## Fast proof (60 seconds)

* **Live check:** Open the `nz-cloud-baseline-aws` README and run the “Proof” steps (ALB response + target health).
* **Ops mindset:** Skim `nz-ops-runbooks` → incident response + postmortem templates + change/DR checklists.
* **Story + context:** `nz-sponsor-portfolio` ties the repos to real job responsibilities and review order.

## Featured projects

### 1) nz-sponsor-portfolio — BEGIN HERE - What to review first (and why)

**Why it matters:** makes it easy to evaluate my work quickly without guessing where to start.
➡️ Repo: [https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-sponsor-portfolio](https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-sponsor-portfolio)

### 2) nz-cloud-baseline-aws — AWS baseline with Terraform (VPC, ALB, private EC2 via SSM)

**Why it matters:** controlled ingress, private compute (**no SSH**), and ops-minded defaults you can explain in an interview.
➡️ Repo: [https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-cloud-baseline-aws](https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-cloud-baseline-aws)

### 3) nz-ops-runbooks — Operational runbooks & templates (incident, change, DR)

**Why it matters:** shows I think beyond “deploy” into **operate + recover + improve**.
➡️ Repo: [https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-ops-runbooks](https://github.com/justin-henson/nz-ops-runbooks)

## Skills snapshot

* **Terraform** (modules, clean diffs, predictable destroy)
* **AWS** (VPC networking, IAM, ALB, SSM, VPC endpoints)
* **Linux + CLI** (debugging, automation, operational workflows)
* **Ops/SRE** (runbooks, incident/postmortems, DR thinking)

## NZ/AU-friendly

I’m targeting **Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure** roles in **New Zealand and Australia** and can align working hours for NZ/AU overlap.
