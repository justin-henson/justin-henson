# Justin Henson — Cloud / DevOps Engineer (AU/NZ-ready)

I build production-minded cloud infrastructure with Terraform — secure by default, easy to operate, and repeatable to demo (create → verify → destroy).

## **Start here (fastest review path)**

Recommended review order:

1. **Portfolio index** — context, narrative, and reviewer path
   ➜ [https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-sponsor-portfolio](https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-sponsor-portfolio)

2. **AWS Terraform baseline** — core cloud infra (VPC, ALB, private EC2 via SSM)
   ➜ [https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-cloud-baseline-aws](https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-cloud-baseline-aws)

3. **Ops / SRE runbooks** — incident, change, DR, and operational discipline
   ➜ [https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-ops-runbooks](https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-ops-runbooks)

## **Fast proof (60 seconds)**

* **Live check:** open the `au-nz-cloud-baseline-aws` README and run the *Proof* steps (ALB response + target health)
* **Ops mindset:** skim `au-nz-ops-runbooks` for incident response, postmortems, change & DR templates
* **Story & context:** `au-nz-sponsor-portfolio` ties everything to realistic job responsibilities
