# Justin Henson — Cloud / DevOps Portfolio (NZ & AU-ready)

I build **production-minded cloud infrastructure** with **Terraform**, focusing on **security, operability, and repeatable demos** (create → verify → destroy).

## Start here
1) **NZ Sponsor Portfolio (index + narrative):** [`nz-sponsor-portfolio`](./nz-sponsor-portfolio)  
2) **AWS Terraform baseline (hands-on infra):** [`nz-cloud-baseline-aws`](./nz-cloud-baseline-aws)  
3) **Ops / SRE documentation & templates:** [`nz-ops-runbooks`](./nz-ops-runbooks)

## What you’ll find in my repos
- **Clear “what/why” up top** (what it demonstrates + tradeoffs)
- **Architecture diagrams** (Mermaid)
- **Proof steps** you can run to verify it works
- **Run / Destroy** commands for clean, repeatable demos
- **Security + Cost notes** (what’s locked down, what drives spend)

## Featured projects

### 1) `nz-cloud-baseline-aws` — AWS baseline with Terraform (VPC, ALB, private EC2 via SSM)
**Why it matters:** shows real infrastructure patterns: controlled ingress, private compute (no SSH), and ops-minded defaults.  
**Highlights:**
- VPC with public/private subnets across 2 AZs
- ALB → Target Group → private instance
- Systems Manager (SSM) access (no inbound SSH)
- Practical run/destroy workflow for interview demos

➡️ Repo: [`nz-cloud-baseline-aws`](./nz-cloud-baseline-aws)

### 2) `nz-ops-runbooks` — Operations runbooks & templates (incident, change, DR)
**Why it matters:** demonstrates that I think beyond “deploy” into **operate + recover + improve**.  
**Highlights:**
- Incident response + postmortem templates
- Change management notes/checklists
- DR planning notes + operational workflows
- Small automation helpers where useful

➡️ Repo: [`nz-ops-runbooks`](./nz-ops-runbooks)

### 3) `nz-sponsor-portfolio` — Sponsor-ready portfolio index (what to review + order)
**Why it matters:** makes it easy to evaluate my work quickly without guessing where to start.  
**Highlights:**
- Recommended review path
- One-page story tying repos to job responsibilities
- Architecture overview and quick verification links

➡️ Repo: [`nz-sponsor-portfolio`](./nz-sponsor-portfolio)

## Tech I use (and why)
- **Terraform** (repeatable infra, clean diffs, predictable destroy)
- **AWS** (baseline patterns: VPC networking, ALB, IAM, SSM, VPC endpoints)
- **Linux + CLI** (operational workflows, debugging, automation)
- **Ops practices** (runbooks, incident/postmortems, DR thinking)

## Notes on cost / safety for demos
Some AWS demos can incur charges while running (especially ALBs and VPC interface endpoints).  
Every repo is designed so you can **destroy resources cleanly** right after verification.
