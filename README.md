# Justin Henson — Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure

I build and operate AWS infrastructure with Terraform—secure defaults, clean troubleshooting, and demos you can validate fast.

**What I can do:** build/ship reliable cloud infrastructure, tighten security defaults, and write the runbooks so on-call isn’t chaos.

## AU/NZ availability
- Based in Texas (Central Time, CT).
- **NZ (Auckland/Wellington):** I can overlap **12:00pm–4:00pm NZT** (typically Mon–Fri).
- **AU (Sydney/Melbourne):** I can overlap **8:00am–2:00pm AEDT** (typically Mon–Fri).
- Interview windows: Weekdays **6:00–10:00pm CT**, weekends by arrangement.
- Work status: Targeting roles in Australia and New Zealand; open to sponsorship and relocation.
- Role preference: Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure (Terraform + AWS; ops/runbooks/incident response).

1. **Portfolio index** — context, narrative, and reviewer path
   ➜ [https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-sponsor-portfolio](https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-sponsor-portfolio)

2. **AWS Terraform baseline** — core cloud infra (VPC, ALB, private EC2 via SSM)
   ➜ [https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-cloud-baseline-aws](https://github.com/justin-henson/au-nz-cloud-baseline-aws)

3. **Ops / SRE runbooks** — incident, change, DR, and operational discipline
